    <h1> Autumn</h1>
    <p> As autumn arrives, the trees put on a show,<br> Their leaves ablaze in colors that glow.<br> As the leaves gently fall, one by one, <br> The season of change has surely begun. <br> A reminder of nature's cycle, year after year,<br> Autumn leaves, filled with magic and cheer. <br> So let's embrace this season, with open arms, <br> As we witness nature's captivating charms. <br> For in the fluttering leaves, we find quiet and peace, <br> A reminder that beauty can bring us release.
